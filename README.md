# üìå **Professional Profile**

Specialist in Backend Development and Artificial Intelligence, focused on building robust, scalable, and business-impactful solutions. I work with modern software architecture, including Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and solid engineering practices.

I have experience developing critical systems, complex integrations (such as automations in z/OS environments), SaaS applications, and Machine Learning products applied to real business scenarios, such as intelligent ticket classification and automated financial analysis.

I am driven by challenges that require innovation, strategic modeling, and systemic thinking. My goal is to combine technology with purpose, delivering solutions that generate real value, always considering security, performance, and maintainability.

I believe in continuous growth, both professionally and personally. As a Level 1 autistic individual, I bring a differentiated perspective to problem-solving, with attention to detail and disciplined execution.

Key Skills:

- Backend Development (Python/FastAPI, Node.js)
- Software Architecture (DDD, Hexagonal, Clean Architecture)
- Business-Oriented Machine Learning
- Legacy Systems Integration (z/OS, SSH, critical automations)
- MVP Design and Product-Market Fit Validation
- Process Automation and Data Engineering
